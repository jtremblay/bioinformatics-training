## Summary
The NRC's pipeline's (this repository) core libraries were forked from the GenPipes (https://doi.org/10.1101/459552) repository (formely the mugqic_pipeline repository) on August 16th 2014. This repository only holds the AmpliconTagger pipeline for the moment. AmpliconTagger is a pipeline designed to process short amplicon sequencing marker or functional gene sequencing data. An overview of the pipeline is described in the following figure. A preprint describing the full methodology of the pipeline will be available soon. A diagram of the pipeline is shown at the bottom of this page.

## Reference and help
We provide a CentOS-7 image that contains all that is needed to run AmpliconTagger. It contains the third party softwares, modules, databases and a subset of sequencing libraries from the AAD study.
